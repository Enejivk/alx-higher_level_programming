# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

# Background Context
<p>JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:
<ul>
<li>Scripting (same as we did with Python)</li>
<li>Web front-end</li>
</ul>
For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting. After, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.
